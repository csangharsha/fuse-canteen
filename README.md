Fuse Canteen is an application to ease Food Management and Ordering Process.

## Problem Statement:
A person who owns Canteen is having trouble managing foods prepared. He/She is unable to figure out that the food prepared will sell or will go to waste. Employees are having trouble deciding what to eat and what to order. We need to create an application so that the Canteen owner can manage his/her food and Employees can order efficiently.

## Requirements:
Two roles -> Admin, Employee (Fuse Employees)

### Roles of Admin:
1. Add Food Items with Price (CRUD) 
2. Prepare a list of food items for today 
3. View orders made by Employee

### Roles of Employee:
